# necrodancer-custom-music
CLI tool used to import custom music into Crypt of the Necrodancer without being in-game.

## Rundown
1) Downloads the provided media URL with `youtube-dl`
2) Converts the media to `MP3` format with `ffmpeg` or any other valid converter
3) Beat-maps the audio file with `beattracker` based on `essentia` (shipped with the game on Windows); alternatively, uses a static beats-per-minute value
4) Edits the game's save-file (`xml`) and add the song in

Remarks:
- audio files are stored in `./music/`; the game is directed to use them here 
- beat map files are stored in `(game-dir)/data/custom_music/` 
- âš  the file seems to be stored in the game's memory as it is running, and is re-generated whenever some actions are taken (e.g.: starting a run, changing the music settings manually, advancing to a new floor?)

## Usage
- clone/fork the repo
- run `npm` or `yarn`
- run `npm run init` or `yarn run init`
- edit `config.json` and fill in the `directory` property with your Crypt of the Necrodancer install directory
- make sure to back up your game save file before proceeding - in case it needs to be rolled back
- run script with `node ./index.js` or `./index.js` (with shebang)

### Arguments
```./index.js (video-url) (zone-id) [-h|--help] [--bpm] [--offset] [--force-reload] [--beat-tracker]```

- `-h`, `--help` Prints a simple usage help
- `(video-url)` First argument - media video link to be downloaded, beat-mapped and added to the game
- `(zone-id)` Second argument - game zone identifier
- `--bpm=#` If provided, the beat will be static, and generated from the provided BPM number
- `--offset=#` If provided along with `--bpm`, the beats will be shifted forward by this offset - provided in **seconds**
- `--force-reload` Re-downloads the audio file, and re-runs beat mapping even if the files are already present
- `--beat-tracker` When using automatic beat mapping, this is the path to the beat-mapping executable.
If not provided, uses the default one found on Windows in `(game-dir)/data/essentia/beattracker.exe` 
- `--debug` Enables debug logging

### Zone identifiers
Each song can be bound to exactly one game zone track per execution.
The full list of identifiers can be found in `./zone-map.json`, and edited - if this is desired

#### Regular zones
These follow the identifier format `(zone)-(level)`, ranging from `1-1` through `5-3`.

#### Boss zones
Boss areas can use either of multiple identifiers:

| Boss  |Full | Simple | Code  |
| :---- |:---:|  :---: | :---: |
| King Conga Kappa | `king-conga`   | `conga` | `boss-1` |
| Deep Blues       | `deep-blues`   | `chess` | `boss-2` |
| Death Metal      | `death-metal`  | `metal` | `boss-3` |
| Coral Riff       | `coral-riff`   | `bass`  | `boss-4` |
